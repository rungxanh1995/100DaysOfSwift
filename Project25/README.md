## About
SelfieShare is an app that lets you and your peers join a peer-to-peer session to share photos and text messages (imagine a walkie-talkie-style convo ðŸ—£ðŸŽ™).

## Concepts Utilized
* `Multipeer Connectivity` and its subclasses
* `UICollectionView`
* `UIMenu`
* Programmatic `AutoLayout`
* Functional programming for code readability & reusability

## Acknowledgement
SelfieShare project is coded in correspondence to Paul Hudsonâ€™s "100 Days Of Swift" challenge, [day 83](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/83) and [day 84](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/84) and [day 79](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/79).

However, the code structure has been drastically refactored to be more readable and reusable, in comparison to the original tutorial.
