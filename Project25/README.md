# SelfieShare
## About
SelfieShare is an app that lets you and your peers join a peer-to-peer session to share photos and text messages (imagine a walkie-talkie-style convo ðŸ—£ðŸŽ™).

## Concepts Utilized
* `Multipeer Connectivity`
* `UICollectionView`
* `UIMenu`
* Programmatic `AutoLayout`
* Functional programming for code readability & reusability

## Acknowledgement
SelfieShare project is coded in correspondence to Paul Hudsonâ€™s "100 Days Of Swift" challenge, [day 83](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/83) and [day 84](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/84).

Furthermore, the code structure has been drastically refactored to be more readable and reusable, in comparison to the original tutorial.

### NOTE

Incidentally 1 chunk of the tutorial wasnâ€™t introduced in that the app wonâ€™t let you connect to an active session if you were following along with the tutorialâ€™s reading. There are several suggested solutions on [the forum](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/forums), in which thereâ€™s 1 from me too [here](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/forums/100-days-of-swift/fix-for-project-25-code-not-letting-you-connect-to-another-hosting-peer/9369).
