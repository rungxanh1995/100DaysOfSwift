## Acknowledgement
Detect-a-Beacon project is coded in correspondence to Paul Hudson’s "100 Days Of Swift" challenge, [day 75](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/75) and [day 76](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/76).

However, the code structure is drastically different from the original tutorial with 100% programmatical AutoLayout and having my own spin.
