## Acknowledgement
Penguin-Ninja project is coded in correspondence to Paul Hudson’s "100 Days Of Swift" challenge, [day 77](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/77), [day 78](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/78) and [day 79](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/79).

However, the code structure is drastically different from the original tutorial with heavily but logically documented & refactored code to be more readable and reusable.
