# #100DaysOfSwift

These are the projects worked on during [Paul Hudson](twitter.com/twostraws)'s #100DaysOfSwift course, which can be found here [https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/)

This is an ongoing repo. I started the challenge in late December 2020, and am still learning Swift 🐦

Feel free to clone and refer to any of my work here 😊
